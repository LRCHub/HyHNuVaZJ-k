City's breaking down on a camel's back
They just have to go 'cause they don't know whack
And all you fill the streets it's appealing to see
They won't get out the county, 'cause they're bad and free
We've got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they've got to kiss, 'cause I don't get sleep, no
Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is sinking, falling down
Love forever, love is free
Let's turn forever you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?
Laughing gas these hazmats and fast cats
We lining them up-a like ass cracks
Lay these ponies at the track
It's my white chocolate attack
Shit, I'm stepping in the heart of this here
Care bear bumping in the heart of this here
Now watch the way I gravitate
Ah ha ha ha
Yo, it's ghost town
This motown
With yo sound
You're in the place
You gonna bite the dust
Can't fight with us
'Cause Bradenton is in the place
So don't stop, get it, get it
Until you're Jet Ahead
Now watch the way I gravitate
Ah ha ha ha
Ha ha ha, oh
Feel good
Ha ha ha, oh
Feel good
Ha ha ha, oh
Feel good
Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is sinking, falling down
Love forever, love is free
Let's turn forever you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?
One, two, three, four
Don't stop, get it, get it
We the kings all up in this
Steady, watch me levitate
Ha ha ha ha
Don't stop, get it, get it
We the kings all up in this
Steady, watch me levitate
Ha ha ha ha
Feel good
Feel good
Feel good
Feel good
